# Mathematical-Language-Compiler
### Compiler where we can give inputs as words or numbers and it will do arithmetic operations on the input and give answer in numbers.

### Run the project.py file to get the input and output. Incase any python libraries are missing (ply and word2num libraries) please install them. It was implemented in Pycharm.
